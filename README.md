# Bloggy McBlog-Face - A TIY Assignment - A Blog

## Synopsis
This was a homework assignment intended to demonstrate understanding of ReactJS, React Router, and Firebase.

The Blog entries were initially created as JSON, and then migrated into a Firebase database. Then I connected Firebase to the React app, and reconfigured scripts etc.

## Tools used
My final stack included:
* JavaScript
* ReactJS
* jQuery
* MomentJS
* Firebase
* CSS3 / FlexBox
* Sass
* webpack

Also used Tyler McGinnis' Firebase-React NPM package called ReBase. Find it here on GitHub. Shout out to Tyler for helping me get past an initial (user error on my part) glich! :)
