    "article" : ["So the first 2 weeks were wonderful. I am in a class/cohort with 9 fun, engaging peers who are all eager to learn javascript. I’ve learned a few awesome things every single day. And now we’re in our third week.",
    "Week three is where my mind is being blown. Every. Single. Day.",
    "I’ve learned some basic javascript before (codeacademy, freecodecamp, teamtreehouse, and a little back in college). I’ve heard programmers before mention things like 'callbacks', 'promises', and other terms before, but never having used them, I didn’t have the foggiest.",
    "Sean (our awesome instructor) has blown my mind. Even while using them in our latest assignment, a simple calculator, I am barely able to wrap my head around callbacks enough to write the code.",
    "Today we’re covering Test-Driven Development, and the basic underlying code behind the most popular TDD testing frameworks, Jasmine Mocha, and, Chai. While I’ve encountered Jasmine before in coding meetups about TDD, I really haven’t understood enough about about how they actually work before. Now I feel like I understand a wee bit better.",
    "Have I mentioned how much I love my team and cohort instructor? They are all pretty amazing people, and we work very well together too. Today we divided into two sub-groups and continued to work on a group portfolio page layout, using git tools that make working as individuals on teams and across teams so much easier. Github makes it so easy to communicate what we’re doing and to share our code changes and documentation (commit messages, etc) with the entire team.",
    "Tomorrow is Friday, and we celebrate by having each of us present for 5–10 minutes on something we’ve learned during the week, or something technical and related to what we’re learning in order to share our thoughts and lessons learned with the entire cohort. I may present on a website I did for a local coffee shop (Jitterbug Coffee Hop)… or else I’ll present more about tools that we use to make working on code a bit easier… like Unix commands, aliases, and functions I use… Helpful features of Bash and ZSH that I find most helpful… and a couple of very nice Atom packages (for Atom code editor.",

    "article" : ["I thought I knew HTML and CSS pretty well. I thought this part of coding bootcamp would be sort of a cakewalk. Okay so I know some stuff, but I now realize that my rate of learning pure CSS3 slowed dramatically when I started using CSS frameworks and libraries (Bootstrap, Foundation, Angular, etc).",
    "Yesterday we were formally introduced to the Flex Box model. Oh my god! This is SO AWESOME!. As a team, we mob programed the base layout for a new group project using flexbox. Not only were we learning some of the pros and cons of some mob programming methods, but we learned a bit of how powerful (and sometimes confusing) using flexbox can be.",
    "I went home feeling that, wow — this is why I am here. This is damned good training for someone like me. Yes, I am comfortable at the Mac/UNIX command line. I am comfortable in using coding editors (and learning new ones — and customizing them). I’m fairly comfortable with git and github. And I am fairly comfortable with BASIC HTML5 and CSS3, and how to find good documentation on elements of both that I haven’t used before (or haven’t used in some new way before). What is great about this training (for me) is that I am getting more experience in working with others, getting and giving help from/to one another, and working on code as a team.",
    "Along the way I am learning some excellent practices that I am incorporating into my own workflow. Our instructor, Sean, has presented to us some great methods for approaching a project in a mindful, thoughtful, organized, and methodical way. His approach has me becoming ever so mindful of specific ways I can improve my own practices.",

    "Now that my first week is complete, I can say that this is where I belong, and I am so optimistic about where my present path is taking me. I can also see that the work I’ve put in on my own, by attending local meet ups and taking online courses with TeamTreeHouse, CodeAcademy, Lynda.com, SafariBooksOnline, and FreeCodeCamp over the past year and a half is paying off!",
    "So… aside from enjoying my first week: What did I learn? Well… a lot of little things here and there, and some major things as well. This first week we focused on HTML, CSS, and getting familiar with the command line, git and github… all things I’ve been familiar with and have been working with for a while now. But we’ve also been learning to help one another, collaborate, try Mob Programming (awesome btw), and (most importantly) to push ourselves more… to try — fail — try — succeed, and to keep working at understanding all the things!",
    "I actually thought I knew enough html and css that this first week would not be challenging enough for me. I was wrong. I learned a lot… a lot of little things… and some huge new things as well. Positioning challenges without using flex-box or javascript, exploring pseudoclasses and just what clear-fix algorithm’s do. I learned some of those things and other stuff too.",
    "I can’t wait for tomorrow (Monday). I can’t wait to learn more… to DO more.",
